Sample code from the project renternote.com

This is a REST server that the client side (not here) communicate with

The code does not use the doctrine ORM the regular way.

Instead I have implemented the Entity Repository framework myself.

The Real Project is a very simple note manager

Feel free to check and use the real project at http://www.renternote.com
